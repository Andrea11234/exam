- About The Project

This project was an assignment for the Master in Data Science at the Universit√† Statale di Milano
We chose "traccia P6", that required us to process the Zoo dataset and apply clustering algorithms to classify the various species using 
a non-supervisioned approach.
After pre-processing the data, we applied the Linear Regression, K Neighbors and K means algorithms to classify the data.
